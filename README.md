**Update:** We made a second iteration, and further progress here: [mirrormirror.glass](http://mirrormirror.glass)

Mirror, Mirror is a technological take on the household mirror. It's main goal is to provide relevant information and data at the user's discretion only. It features:

Webcam
Leap Motion Gestures
Facial Recognition
Event Support
Purdue Bus Support
Text to Speech Incorporation
Constant Weather and News Updates
With these features, it allows the user or any developer to use this product as a framework. You can incorporate this into common households or even businesses.

The main inspiration came from the fact that contextual information can be overloading. From Google Now to Siri, relevant information loses it's value when it is constantly being displayed at almost all moments. Mirror, Mirror aspires to change that. The simplicity of Mirror, Mirror allows for direct control over information that you want to see.

As a whole, Mirror, Mirror aims to change the convention of how information is displayed. Instead of information made for the general public, we aimed at making a product that will display only what YOU want.

Smart mirror application that uses facial recognition to show you relevant data (schedule, bus times, etc) when you walk up to it, all on a monitor position behind a one way mirror.

Only contains source for website/visuals, opencv code will be kept private due to some licensing issues.
